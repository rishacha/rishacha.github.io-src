# Understanding JUnit 5 Testing

I always wanted to learn about `JUnit 5` since testing always consumed a lot of time when I developed my Java Applications. 

## What is JUnit 5? 

From the JUnit documentation site, the definition is as follows : 

**JUnit 5 = JUnit Platform + JUnit Jupiter + JUnit Vintage**

The JUnit Platform serves as a foundation for launching testing frameworks on the JVM. It also defines the `TestEngine` API for developing a testing framework that runs on the platform.

Furthermore, the platform provides a `Console Launcher` to launch the platform from the command line and build plugins for `Gradle` and `Maven` as well as a `JUnit 4 based Runner` for running any TestEngine on the platform.
